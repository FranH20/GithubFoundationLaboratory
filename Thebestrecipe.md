## 🌶️ Instructions

1. **Cook the meats**  
   Place the beef and tripe in a large pot. Cover with water, add salt, and cook over medium heat until tender (about 1.5 hours). Reserve some of the cooking liquid.

2. **Prepare the chili paste**  
   Blend the soaked ají panca and ají amarillo with a little water until smooth.

3. **Make the sofrito**  
   In a large pan, heat oil and sauté the onion until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for one more minute. Stir in the chili paste, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for 10–15 minutes, stirring frequently.

4. **Combine everything**  
   Add the cooked meats to the sofrito. Pour in some of the reserved cooking liquid and simmer for 15 minutes.

5. **Add potatoes**  
   Add the potatoes and cook until they are very soft and begin to break apart, thickening the stew naturally.
